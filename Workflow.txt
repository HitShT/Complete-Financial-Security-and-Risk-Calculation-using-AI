Project Workflow:

1) Basic Details : Age, Gender, Salary/m, Present Assets, All loans with interest rate

2) Preparing for Financial Security:
	
	* Each part will have risk assessment
	i) Safeguarding medical future : 
		a) Choosing from present policies based on preferences. 
		b) Policies are marked based on several factors (tbd)
		c) Policies are ranked based on user importance on features like someone may prioritise pricing, others diseases covered etc
	
	ii) Safeguarding future job loss, emergencies, etc
		a) Creating goals
			1) Safety from job loss
				-> Software will calculate what is needed to save based on several factors like number of dependents, age of dependents, present cost of lifestyle etc
			2) Safety based on unexpected emergencies

	iii) Safeguarding family from accidents (Depends on how many dependents)
		a) Term Insurance and Accidental Insurance
		b) If loans, extra insurance
	
	iv) Savings for future
		
		a) Savings amount based on expected date of expenditure for example loan payment on _ date of every month, policy payment date, college fees, ....
			-> Divide expenditure based on date 
				=> Expenditure within 1 year
				=> Expenditure between 1-3 years
				=> Expenditure between 3-7 years
				=> Long term expenditure like retirement planning, house buying etc
		
			For each show a pie chart: parts of the pie chart will be based on the percentage of investment like equity, mutual funds, bonds, etc.
			If you click on each part, it will show which type should you invest on
	
		*Types of planned investments : Equity, Mutual Funds, Bonds and Gold maybe add more later

3) Small Simple Calculators

	i) Amount to save per month and total :
		-> Based on risk appetite
		-> Based on expenditure
		-> Based on plans for future inheritance for next generations
		-> Date to retirement
		-> Salary
	
	2) Increase in cost of living if present standards are kept
	
	3) Expected amount required for medical expenses, future kid college fees etc
